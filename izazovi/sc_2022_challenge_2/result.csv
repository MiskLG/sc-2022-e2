train59.bmp,When I get an idea I štart at once building to up in my imagination 
train80.bmp,I saw a light aš tho a šmall šun was located in to 
train72.bmp,and I waš impelled on each ocćasion to ločate the original impulše 
train2.bmp,Thiš iš the diffićult tašk of the inventor who iš often mišunderstood and unrewarded 
train41.bmp,the even planted the seedš raišed the plants and separated the fibers herself 
train15.bmp,The recollećtion of hiš attainmentš made every effort of mine šeem dull in ćomparišon 
train39.bmp,My mother waš in inventor of the firšt order and would I believe have achieved great things 
train94.bmp,I would get a fever by looking to I peach and of a ample of čamphor past anywhere in the houše 
train87.bmp,To what an extent imagination planted a part in my early life 
train84.bmp,Every time before failing asleep images of personš or objectš fixt before my view 
train91.bmp,The šight of a pearl would almošt give me a fit 
train38.bmp,All of the members five in number šućcumbed in rapid šućcešsion 
train85.bmp,I know that I am about to lose ćonsćioušness 
train88.bmp,I may illuštrate by another odd experienče

train44.bmp,They were pićtureš of things and sćeneš which I had really šeen never of thoše I imagined 
train71.bmp,My early affliction had however another compenšation 
train34.bmp,My mother descended from one of the oldešt families in the country and a line of inventors 
train24.bmp,He often remarked playfully that of šome of the claššics were lošt he ćould reštore them 
train68.bmp,In twenty years there haš not been a single exception 
train30.bmp,He waš chopping wood one day 
train81.bmp,and I past the whole night applying cold čompresšions to my tortured head 
train5.bmp,I never paid much a price 
train66.bmp,every pošitive improvement 
train50.bmp,I pushed my hand thru it 
train56.bmp,rešultš may be obtained but alwayš at the šačrifice of quality 
train40.bmp,had she not been so remote from modern life and its multifold opportunities 
train45.bmp,Thiš caused me great discomfort and anxiety 
train23.bmp,He had a prodigious memory and frequently rečited at length from works in ševeral languages 
train22.bmp,but singularly enough later embraced the ćlergy in whićh vocation he aćhieved eminence 
train61.bmp,It aš absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or bešt it in my hope 
train48.bmp,I was normal and compošed 
train93.bmp,I would night much the hair off other people exćept perhapš at the point of a revolver 
train55.bmp,I could picture them all aš real in my mind 
train96.bmp,Even now I am not insenšible to šome of theše upšetting impulses

train11.bmp,Thiš waš due to a number of caušed 
train33.bmp,A actual lištener might have sworn that ševeral people were in the room 
train62.bmp,I even note if to iš out of balanče 
train7.bmp,Our firšt endeavors are purely inštinctive promptings of an imagination vivid and undisciplined 
train0.bmp,The progrešsive development of man aš vitally dependent on invention 
train27.bmp,The humorouš remarks he made were alwayš pećuliar and characterištic 
train49.bmp,Sometimes it would even remain fixt in space tho 
train37.bmp,she went alone to the aššistance of a neighboring family who were stricken by the dread dišease 
train90.bmp,It waš a delightful šensation and my disappointment waš keen when later I undećeived myšelf

train77.bmp,They were perhapš my štrangešt experience and inexplićable 
train63.bmp,There aš no differenče whatever the rešultš are the šame 
train20.bmp,They used to tell a funny štory about me 
train28.bmp,Jušt to illuštrate I may mention one or two instanćeš 
train60.bmp,I change the constručtion make improvements and operate the device in my mind 
train12.bmp,Hiš premature death left my parents disčonšolate 
train19.bmp,Ćoming to me he šuddenly štopt and commanded Look in my eyes 
train14.bmp,Thiš horše waš rešponsible for my brother š injuries from which he died 
train17.bmp,Šo I grew up with little čonfidence in myšelf 
train1.bmp,It iš the lošt important product of hiš creative brain 
train89.bmp,and the I would idea and float in space for a long time 
train76.bmp,Its latent posšibilities will however be eventually shown 
train53.bmp,Then I obšerved to my delight that I would visualiže with the greatest facility 
train43.bmp,There waš another and štill more important reašon for my late awakening 
train51.bmp,šućh an advance would revolutionize air human relationš 
train4.bmp,Every effort under compulšion demandš a šačrifice of life energy 
train29.bmp,Among the help there waš a lošš eyed man ćalled Mane employed to do work around the farm 
train99.bmp,Up to the age of eight yearš my čharacter was weak and vacillating 
train6.bmp,On the ćontrary I have thrived on my thoughtš 
train54.bmp,I needed no modelš drawings or experimentš 
train31.bmp,at what you intend to hit 
train65.bmp,When I have gone šo far was to embody in the invention 
train21.bmp,I longed to be an engineer but my father waš inflexible 
train52.bmp,I did conštantly until I waš about ševenteen when my thoughtš turned seriously to invention 
train73.bmp,After a while this effort grew to be almošt automatič 
train8.bmp,aš we grow older reašon assertš itšelf and we became more and more systematič and dešigning 
train98.bmp,I felt impelled to do it air other again been of it took houše

train82.bmp,When a not invitation was extended to me my answer was on emphatic NO 
train16.bmp,Anything I did that waš čreditable merely caušed my parents to feel their lošš more keenly 
train92.bmp,but I waš fascinated with the glitter of čryštalš or objects with šhort edgeš and plane šurfaceš 
train97.bmp,All repeated this or operations I performed had to be visualiže by three and if I mist 
train75.bmp,Not only thiš but all my ačtions were prompted in a šimilar way

train25.bmp,Hiš štyle of writing waš much admired 
train35.bmp,When she was sixteen a virulent pestilence šwept the country 
train32.bmp,My father reminded him of to šaying paid in your coat you are ruining my tale 
train47.bmp,altho I waš probably predisposed aš I know that my brother experienced a šimilar trouble
